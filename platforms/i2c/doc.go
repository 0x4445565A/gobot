/*
This package provides drivers for i2c (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)devices . It is normally not used directly, but instead is registered by an adaptor such as firmata (https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/firmata) that supports the needed interfaces for i2c devices.

Installing:

	go get github.com/hybridgroup/gobot && go install github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/i2c

For further information refer to i2c README:
